### Instructors
Carpentry Instructors are the core of our community. Instructors organize and teach Carpentry workshops to spread data literacy and programmatic skills both locally and globally. Members of our Instructor community work together to actively grow their instructional and technical skills. Becoming an Instructor is a great step to leveling-up your own technical skills and helps you to become a more effective technical communicator. 

* [Training materials](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)
* Responsibilities: Teach at least one workshop within your first year as an Instructor. Teach at least one workshop every two years to stay a voting member of the Carpentry community.
* [Apply to become an Instructor](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/) 
* For more information contact [Erin Becker](mailto:ebecker@carpentries.org).

### Mentoring

Mentoring is how our global instructors come together to support each other and develop new teaching and 
technical skills. We create an open and inviting environment through Instructor discussion sessions and 
project-based small mentorship groups.

#### Mentoring Groups

Mentoring Groups support instructors in a variety of ways. Whether you are a new instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned instructor hoping to launch workshops in a new community, or an instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, mentoring groups will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal.
