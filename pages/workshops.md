<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/">Software Carpentry</a> workshops 
or <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops/">Data Carpentry</a> workshops generally 
comprise two full days of face-to-face instruction, based on 
either <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons">Software Carpentry</a> 
or <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons">Data Carpentry</a> lesson materials. 

Audiences generally comprise postgraduate students and early career researchers, but may include postdocs, undergraduates, and
others working within a research framework, for example, in government or industry. See [sample learner profiles](https://software-carpentry.org/audience).

They are taught by volunteer Instructors. Instructors perform live coding and learners work on their own machines. Certified 
Instructors comprise people who 
have completed our <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor training</a> course. 

<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons">Software Carpentry</a> 
and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons">Data Carpentry</a> lessons are all 
open source, and are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
