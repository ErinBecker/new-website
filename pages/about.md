 <h2>About The Carpentries</h2>
 
The Carpentries project comprises <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> 
and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>, communities of Instructors, Trainers, Lesson Maintainers, 
helpers and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. 
The Carpentries subscribe to a 
shared <a href="http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. In January, 2018, Data and Software Carpentry merged their projects to form <strong>The Carpentries</strong>. The Carpentries are a fiscally sponsored project of <a href="http://communityin.org">Community Initiatives</a>, a 501(c)3 non-profit incorporated in the United States. See our <a href="http://info.carpentries.org/">FAQs</a>.

<h4>What is a Carpentries Workshop?</h4>

<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/">Software Carpentry workshops</a> 
or <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops/">Data Carpentry workshops</a> generally 
comprise two full days of face-to-face instruction, based on 
either <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons">Software Carpentry</a> 
or <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons">Data Carpentry lesson materials</a>. 
They are taught by volunteer Instructors. Certified Instructors comprise people who 
have completed our <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor training</a> course. 
Instructors perform live coding and learners follow along. 
<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons">Software Carpentry</a> 
and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons">Data Carpentry</a> lessons are all 
open source, and are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
